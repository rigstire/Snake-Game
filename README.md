# Snake-Game
Like the normal snake game, however, the snake takes a couple moves to digest the food.
Use a,w,s,d keys to move the snake. a for left, s for down, d for right, w for up. The game is played on a 10x10 board, you lose
if the snake colides with the boarder of the board, or colides with itself.
